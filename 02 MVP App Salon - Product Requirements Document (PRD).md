# **Low-Friction Digital Workflow Tool Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

## **Goals and Background Context**

* **Goals**  
  * Improve process efficiency by creating digital tools that users willingly adopt.  
  * Enhance data quality and accessibility by seamlessly capturing information that is currently handled manually.  
  * Reduce administrative overhead by automating the processing of user-captured data.  
  * Achieve a high user adoption rate, with staff using the tool as part of their regular workflow.  
  * Deliver a measurable reduction in task time compared to the manual alternative.  
* Background Context  
  This project addresses the critical issue of low user adoption for digital tools in service-oriented environments. The core problem is not a lack of features, but high cognitive friction caused by a mismatch between a tool's workflow and a user's natural, in-the-moment mental model.  
  The proposed solution is a mobile-first, photo-based form submission tool. It allows service providers to capture handwritten notes via a photo, which is then automatically transcribed using OCR. This approach respects their existing habits and minimizes disruption, aiming to create a near-effortless user experience that drives adoption and improves data quality.

## **Requirements**

* **Functional Requirements**  
  1. The system must provide a mobile-optimized web interface where a user can select their name from a predefined list. 1

  2. The interface must allow the user to capture an image using their device's camera. 22

  3. The system must upload the captured image data along with the selected user's name to the backend workflow. 3

  4. The backend workflow must automatically transcribe handwritten text from the uploaded image using the Google Cloud Vision API.  
  5. The backend workflow must save the original uploaded image file to a designated Google Drive folder. 4

  6. The system must organize saved files into monthly subfolders within Google Drive (e.g., "2025-09"). 55555555

  7. The user interface must display clear status messages for success, failure, and in-progress states. 66666

* **Non-Functional Requirements**  
  1. The user interface must be a static web application hosted on a modern platform such as Vercel or Netlify.  
  2. The application must be lightweight and performant on low-specification mobile devices, even over slow network connections.  
  3. The backend logic for file processing and OCR must be implemented as an n8n workflow.  
  4. The UI must be highly intuitive, requiring no formal training for non-tech-savvy users. 7

  5. All image files must be stored securely in Google Drive, with access managed by standard Google permissions.

## **User Interface Design Goals**

* Overall UX Vision  
  The user experience must be defined by extreme simplicity and speed. It's a "one-task, one-screen" application designed to eliminate cognitive load. The entire flow should feel intuitive and immediate to a non-technical user on a mobile device.  
* Key Interaction Paradigms  
  The core interaction is a simple, linear flow:  
  1. Select Name from a dropdown. 8

  2. Tap a single, clear call-to-action button ("Take Photo"). 9

  3. The native device camera opens. 10

  4. Upon photo confirmation, the upload process begins automatically. 111111

* Core Screens and Views  
  There is only one primary screen: the Upload Screen. This screen contains the name selector, the action button, and a status display area.  
* **Accessibility**  
  * **Target:** We will aim for **WCAG AA** compliance to ensure the application is usable by people with a wide range of abilities.  
* **Branding**  
  * The visual style should be clean, professional, and friendly. The initial design uses a blue/purple gradient and clear, bold fonts to create a modern and approachable feel, which we will use as our starting point. 121212121212121212

* **Target Device and Platforms**  
  * **Web Responsive**, with a strict **mobile-first** design and implementation. 13

## **Technical Assumptions**

* Repository Structure: Polyrepo  
  The project will be structured as a Polyrepo. The frontend will exist in its own repository, and the n8n workflow will be developed and managed separately.  
* Service Architecture  
  The architecture is a fully decoupled serverless model. The frontend UI is a static site deployed on Vercel/Netlify. It communicates directly with the backend, which is an n8n workflow triggered by a webhook.  
* Testing Requirements  
  We will adopt a Unit \+ Integration testing approach.  
  * **Frontend:** Simple unit tests will be written for the JavaScript logic.  
  * **Backend (n8n):** An integration test will be created to call the n8n webhook and verify that the corresponding image file is correctly created in Google Drive.  
* **Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests**  
  * The frontend **must** be built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
  * The UI **must** be hosted on a modern static hosting platform like Vercel or Netlify.  
  * The OCR processing **must** use the Google Cloud Vision API.  
  * File storage  
    **must** be Google Drive. 14

## **Epic List**

* **Epic 1: Foundational Setup & Core Transcription MVP**  
  * **Goal:** To establish the project's foundational infrastructure and deliver a functional MVP of the photo-to-text transcription service.
